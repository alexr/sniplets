When you are not doing UIs all day long, with all the tools, sometime it is still
simpler to just copy a template and modify it to get a simple UI.

`WinformsTemplate` is one of such projects, with adjustable split container
and a status bar, plus some basic interaction across controls.

```
+---------+-----------------------+
| Tree    | Text                  |
|         |                       |
|         |                       |
|         |                       |
+---------+-----------------------+
| Status                          |
+---------------------------------+
```
